```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
manager <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
date <- c("24/10/08", "28/10/08", "01/10/08", "12/10/08", "01/05/09")
country <- c("US", "US", "UK", "UK", "UK")
gender <- c("M", "F", "F", "M", "F")
age <- c(32, 45, 25, 39, 99)
q1 <- c(5, 3, 3, 3, 2)
q2 <- c(4, 5, 5, 3, 2)
q3 <- c(5, 2, 5, 4, 1)
q4 <- c(5, 5, 5, NA, 2)
q5 <- c(5, 5, 2, NA, 1)
leadership <- data.frame(manager, date, country, gender, age, q1, q2, q3, q4, q5,
                         stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

### Create New Variables
We always create new variables through this syntax.
```r
variable_name <- expression
```
The composition above, *expression* can involve many operators and functions, 
here are some arithmetic operators that can form formulas.
```{r table-knit-1, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  operator = c("\\+", "\\-", "\\*", "/", "^ or **", "x %% y", "x %/% y"),
  description = c("Add",
                  "Subtract",
                  "Multiply",
                  "Divide",
                  "Exponentiation",
                  "Complementation(x mod y), 5 %% 2 = 1",
                  "Integer Division, 5 %/% 2 = 2")
)
kable(data, caption = "Arithmetic operators") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1:2, width = "5cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
1. Function **transform()** can do anything useful with data frames currently. Here
is an example, we use this function to add two variables to data frame mydata.
```{r, include = TRUE}
mydata <- data.frame(x1 = c(2, 2, 6, 4), x2 = c(3, 4, 2, 8))
mydata <- transform(mydata, sumx = x1 + x2, meanx = (x1 + x2) / 2)
mydata
```
### Reencoding of Variables
If we want to encode a variable, we may use the logical operator.
```{r table-knit-2, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  operator = c("<", "<=", ">", ">=", "==", "!=", "!x", "x | y", "x & y", "isTRUE(x)"),
  description = c("Less than",
                  "Less than or equal to",
                  "Greater than",
                  "Greater than or equal to",
                  "Exactly equal to",
                  "Not equal to",
                  "Not x",
                  "x or y",
                  "x and y",
                  "Test if x is TRUE")
)
kable(data, caption = "Logical operators", escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1:2, width = "5cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
2. Clause **variable[condition] <- expression** will only assign value to the 
variable when *condition* is *TRUE*.
```{r, include = TRUE}
# If we have a data frame including a vector named age in it
head(leadership$age)
# age 99 is a NA value
# We want to encode the age to categorical variable
leadership$age[leadership$age == 99] <- NA
leadership <- within(leadership, {
                    agecat <- NA
                    agecat[age > 75] <- "Elder"
                    agecat[age >= 55 & age <= 75] <- "Middle Aged"
                    agecat[age < 55] <- "Young"})
head(leadership$agecat)
```
3. Funciton **within()** resembles function **with()**, but it can modify the data
frame.
4. `NA` is a keyword in R.

### Rename Variables
5. We can use interactive window to change a variable name using function **fix()**.
This function always takes effect on a data frame.
```r
fix(leadership)
```
The above clause will enable a pop-up window, in which we can modify variable names.
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Pop-up window to modify variable names"}
knitr::include_graphics("4_1.png")
```
6. Alternatively, we can modify variable names via coding using function **names()**.
This function has been introduced former. Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
names(leadership)
names(leadership)[2] <- "testDate"
names(leadership)[6 : 10] <- c("item1", "item2", "item3", "item4", "item5")
head(leadership)
```
7. In package **plyr**, we have a function **rename()** to do that, the format 
is as belows.
```r
rename(dataframe, c(oldname = "newname", oldname = "newname", ...))
```
Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
library(plyr)
leadership <- rename(leadership, c(manager = "managerID", testDate = "date"))
tail(leadership)
```
8. Package *plyr* has a series of dataset operation functions, we can look for it
on <*http://had.co.nz/plyr*>.

### Missing Value
9. There are some functions in R can help us probe the NA values **is.na()**. This 
function will return a corresponding binary dimensions matrix to specify if the 
elements are NA. Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
y <- c(1, 2, 3, NA)
is.na(y)
is.na(leadership[, 6 : 10])
```
10. There are two keys to be remember: Firstly, the NA value can not be compare, even 
compare itself, that means `myvar == NA` will never be *TRUE*. Secondly, R will 
not label the infinite values or impossible values to NA. For instance, the clause
`5 / 0` returns *Inf* but not *NA*, `sin(Inf)` returns *NAN* means not a number, but 
not *NA*. Only the missing value can be *NA*. We can use **is.infinite()** or 
**is.nan()** to handle these cases.
11. Please ensure before any analysis, we have labeled the missing values to NA.
12. Be careful when dealing with the missing values, if a function has some missing
values as its input, then its output will also be missing value. Fortunately, every
multiple input function has a property can eliminate the missing values `na.rm = TRUE`.
Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, NA, 3)
y1 <- x[1] + x[2] + x[3] + x[4]
y1
z1 <- sum(x)
z1
z2 <- sum(x, na.rm = TRUE)
z2
```
13. In addition, function **na.omit()** can omit every row has missing values. 
Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
head(leadership)
newdata <- na.omit(leadership)
head(newdata)
```
Delete all the observations having missing values can be a method when dealing 
with some of the cases, but it is just a junior strategy, we will discuss some
senior strategies later.

### Date Value
14. Date value often input into R as strings, then transform to numbers, function
**as.Date()** can do this transformation. It's prototype is here.
```r
as.Date(x, "input_format")
```
The above parameter, *x* is character type data, *input_format* is the suitable
type for date input.
```{r table-knit-3, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  operator = c("%d", "%a", "%A", "%m", "%b", "%B", "%y", "%Y"),
  description = c("Day as a number(0 ~ 31)",
                  "Abbreviated weekday",
                  "Unabbreviated weekday",
                  "Month(0 ~ 12)",
                  "Abbreviated month",
                  "Unabbreviated month",
                  "Two-digit year",
                  "Four-digit year"),
  instance = c("0 ~ 31", "Mon", "Monday", "00 ~ 12", "Jan", "January", "07", "2007")
)
kable(data, caption = "Date type", escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1:3, width = "5cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
The default format for date value as input is `yyyy-mm-dd`.
```{r, include = TRUE}
# This clause transforms the character type data to corresponding date.
mydates <- as.Date(c("2007-06-22", "2004-02-13"))
mydates
# This clause uses `mm/dd/yyyy` type to read data
strDates <- c("01/05/1965", "08/16/1975")
dates <- as.Date(strDates, "%m/%d/%Y")
dates
```
Use specified type to read character type variable and substitute it for the data
frame variable as a date variable.

15. **Sys.Date()** can return the current date, and **date()** can return the current
date and current time.
16. We can use **format(x, format = "output_format")** to print the specified date
and extract part of the date. This function can receive a parameter and print it
in specified types.
17. In R, when store dates, it uses days from January 1, 1970. The days earlier 
than this day will be stored as a negative. And we can do some calculation on dates,
but remember, we must transform the date value using *as.Date()* before that.
18. Function **difftime()** can be used to calculate the time interval, and output
in week, day, hour, minute, second. The syntax of this is **difftime(end, start, units = "weeks")**

### Type Conversion
19. There are many data types in R, and resembles other statistical programming
languages, all these can transform each other.
```{r table-knit-4, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  judgement = c("is.numeric()", "is.character()", "is.vector()", "is.matrix()",
                "is.data.frame()", "is.factor()", "is.logical()"),
  transformation = c("as.numeric()",
                  "as.character()",
                  "as.vector()",
                  "as.matrix()",
                  "as.data.frame()",
                  "as.factor()",
                  "as.logical()")
)
kable(data, caption = "Data type operation function", escape = FALSE, format = "html") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1:2, width = "5cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
The above functions, the form *is.datatype()* return TRUE or FALSE, the form *as.datatype()* convert the argument to that type.

### Data Sorting
20. We always use function **order()** to sort data frames, the sorting order is
ascending by default. If we want to sort it by descending order, then add a minus
sign before the sorting variable. Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
# Create a new data frame, the rows are sorted by age ascending
newdata <- leadership[order(leadership$age), ]
newdata
# Sorts the rows into female followed by male, and youngest to oldest within each gender
attach(leadership)
  newdata <- leadership[order(gender, age), ]
  newdata
detach(leadership)
# Sorts the rows by gender, and then from oldest to youngest manager within each gender
attach(leadership)
  newdata <- leadership[order(gender, -age), ]
  newdata
detach(leadership)
```
It's worth noting that, function *order()* takes the order of parameters as the 
sorting orders. `order(A, B)` will sort the data frame or something others by A
then by B. And the return of this function is usually a vector contains the serial
number of each element. For instance, `order(c(21, 52, 42, 12, 30)) = [4, 1, 5, 3, 2]`.
Btw, remember the reference rule of data frame's elements can be helpful to understand
the above code clause.

### Merging Datasets
21. Function **merge()** can merge two data frames horizontally, on many cases, 
two data frames have one or more common variables to link, it is also called 
inner join. Here is an example.
```r
# Merge two data frames by ID
total <- merge(dataframeA, dataframeB, by = "ID")
# Merge two data frames by ID and country
total <- merge(dataframeA, dataframeB, by = c("ID", "Country"))
```
The similar link is often used to add variables to data frames.

22. If we want to merge two matrixes or data frames directly without a key, just 
use function **cbind()**. `total <- cbind(A, B)`. Every element must have same 
number of rows and sorted in same sequence.
23. If we need to merge two matrixes vertically, use function **rbind()**. `total <- rbind(dataframeA, dataframeB)`. Two data frames must have same variables, if not,
delete the redundant variables in one data frame or add a new variable to the other
variable and set the values NA.

### Subsetting Datasets
#### Select Variables
24. In data frame, we select variables through `dataframe[row_indices, column_indices]`.
Alternatively, we can select it through its name, here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
myvars <- c("item1", "item2", "item3", "item4", "item5")
newdata <- leadership[myvars]
newdata
```
#### Dropping Variables
```{r, include = TRUE}
leadership_temp <- leadership
myvars <- names(leadership) %in% c("item3", "item4")
newdata <- leadership[!myvars]
# names(leadership) creates a character vector contains all variable names
# names(leadership) %in% c("item3", "item4") returns a logical vector, every matched
# element in names(leadership) is TRUE, while the others are FALSE
# operator not(!) reverses the logical value
# leadership[!myvars] select the columns where the logical values are TRUE
newdata <- leadership[c(-8, -9)]
# If we know item3 and item4 is the eighth and ninth variables, we can also use 
# this code to delete the target items
leadership$item3 <- leadership$item4 <- NULL
# Last, same variables deletion can also use this code
leadership <- leadership_temp
```
The above keyword **NULL**, means not defined, is different from NA which means
not applicable.

#### Selecting Observations
It is simple to understand. Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
newdata <- leadership[1 : 3, ]
attach(leadership)
  newdata <- leadership[gender == 'M' & age > 30, ]
detach(leadership)
```
In the above code, we select the first three observations, then select all men 
over 30. `gender == 'M'` and `age > 30` will create logical vectors.
```{r, include = TRUE}
leadership
leadership$date <- as.Date(leadership$date, "%d/%m/%y")
startdate <- as.Date("2009-01-01")
enddate <- as.Date("2009-10-31")
newdata <- leadership[which(leadership$date >= startdate & leadership$date <= enddate), ]
newdata
```
The above clauses, function **which()** can give the TRUE indices of a logical 
object, allowing for array indices. e.g., `which(obj <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, NA, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)) = [1, 3, 7]`.

#### Function subset()
25. Function **subset()** can do the same thing as filtering datasets, here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE}
# Select all observations where ages no less than 35 and smaller than 24
# Keep variables q1 to q4 at the meantime
newdata <- subset(leadership, age >= 35 | age < 24, select = c(item1, item2, item3, item4))
newdata
# Select all men above 25
# Keep variables gender to q4 at the meantime
newdata <- subset(leadership, gender == 'M' & age > 25, select = gender : item4)
newdata
```
#### Random Samples
26. Function **sample()** can take a random sample(with or without replacement) 
of size n from a dataset. Its format is here.
```r
sample(sample_vector, size, replace = TRUE/FALSE)
```
The above parameter, *sample_vector* is the vector of elements to choose from; 
*size* is the sample size, usually is a number; *replace* is to specify choose 
with or without replacement.
```{r, include = TRUE}
mysample <- leadership[sample(1 : nrow(leadership), 3, replace = FALSE), ]
mysample
```
The above code, function *sample()* returns a numeric vector to specify the rows
to choose. The function **nrow()** is used to calculated the number of rows 
leadership has.

### Using SQL to Manipulate Data Frame
27. Surprisingly, we can also use SQL in R to handle data frame, just install
the package **sqldf**. Search on <http://code.google.com/p/sqldf/> to refer more.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
dose <- c(20, 30, 40, 45, 60)
drugA <- c(16, 20, 27, 40, 60)
drugB <- c(15, 18, 25, 31, 40)
```

### Use Graph
1. We can save graphs through code or graphical user interface. To save 
graphics through code, place drawing statements between statements that open the
target graphics device and statements that close the target graphics device. Here
is an example.
```r
pdf("3_1.pdf")
  attach(mtcars)
    plot(wt, mpg)
    abline(lm(mpg~wt))
    title("Regression of MPG on Weight")
  detach(mtcars)
dev.off()
```
2. Function **x11()** without any parameter can be used to create a new graphic
window.
3. Only one device is the ‘active’ device: this is the device in which all 
graphics operations occur. There is a *null device* which is always open but is
really a placeholder. Devices are associated with a name (e.g., "X11" or "postscript")
and a number in the range 1 to 63. The null device is always device 1. Once a 
device has been opened the null device is not considered as a possible active 
device. There is a list of open devices, and this is considered as a circular 
list not including the null device. **dev.next()** and **dev.prev()** select the
next open device in the appropriate direction, unless no device is open. **dev.off()**
shuts down the specified (by default the current) device. If the current device 
is shut down and any other devices are open, the next open device is made current.
It is an error to attempt to shut down device 1. **graphics.off()** shuts down 
all open graphics devices. Normal termination of a session runs the internal 
equivalent of graphics.off(). **dev.set()** makes the specified device the 
active device. If there is no device with that number, it is equivalent to *dev.next()*.
If which = 1 it opens a new device and selects that. **dev.list()** returns the 
numbers of all open devices, except device 1, the null device. This is a numeric
vector with a names attribute giving the device names, or NULL is there is no
open device.
Here is an example.
```r
x11()
plot(1:10)
x11()
plot(rnorm(10))
dev.set(dev.prev())
abline(0, 1)
dev.set(dev.next())
abline(h = 0, col = "gray")
dev.set(dev.prev())
dev.off(); dev.off()
```
### A Simple Example
```{r table-knit-1, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  dose = c(20, 30, 40, 45, 60),
  response_to_drugA = c(16, 20, 27, 40, 60),
  response_to_drugB = c(15, 18, 25, 31, 40)
)
kable(data, caption = "Patients' responses to five dose levels of two drugs") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1:3, width = "5cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
Use the codes below to import the data.
```r
dose <- c(20, 30, 40, 45, 60)
drugA <- c(16, 20, 27, 40, 60)
drugB <- c(15, 18, 25, 31, 40)
```
Use the codes below to create a graph describing correlation between dose of drugA
and responses.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
plot(dose, drugA, type = "b")
```

4. **plot()** is a generic function in R that plots objects. Here, *plot(x, y, type = "b")*
puts x in horizontal axis and y in vertical axis, paint point set (x, y), then link
them with lines. Option *type = "b"* indicates painting points and lines. What's
more, *"p"* for points, *"l"* for lines, *"c"* for empty points joined by lines, 
*"o"* for overplotted points and lines, *"s"* for stair steps and *"h"* for histogram-like
vertical lines, *"n"* for not produce any points or lines. We may talk about other
attributes later.

### Graphics Parameters
We can customize many features of a graph by modifying options called graph
parameters(font, color, axis, label). One way to do this is to specify these 
options via the function **par()**. Parameter values set in this way will remain
in effect until the session ends unless they are modified again. Its syntax is 
**par(optionname = value, optionname = value, ...)** . Call *par()* without 
parameter will generate a list contains current graphic parameter settings. Add
parameter **no.readonly = TRUE** can create a modifiable current graphic parameter
settings list.  
Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
opar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
par(lty = 2, pch = 17) # Equal to par(lty = 2); par(pch = 17)
plot(dose, drugA, type = "b")
par(opar)
```
The first statement above copies the current graphics parameter settings. The 
second statement changes the default line type to a dashed line and the default 
point symbol to a solid triangle. Finally, we draw the graph and restore the
original settings.  
Another way to set graphic parameters is to provide key-value pairs 
*optionname = value* directly to senior graphic functions. But this way only 
take effect in this graph, and not all parameters are available for all specific
senior graphic functions.  
Now, we are going to talk about many graphic parameters.

#### Symbols and Lines
Here are some parameters showed below.
```{r, table-knit-2, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("pch", "cex", "lty", "lwd"),
  description = c("Specifies the symbol to use when plotting points.",
                  "Specifies the symbol size. `cex` is a number indicating the amount by which plotting symbols should be scaled relative to the default.(default = 1)",
                  "Specifies the line type.",
                  "Specifies the line width. `lwd` is expressed relative to the default. (default = 1)")
)
kable(data, caption = "Parameters for specifying symbol and line type") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "3cm", latex_column_spec = "c") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "10cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
Option *pch = * is used to specify the symbols when printing points, belows are
some possible values.

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Plotting symbols specified with the pch parameter"}
knitr::include_graphics("3_1.png")
```
For symbols 21~25, we can also specify the border color(col = ) and fill color(bg = ).  
The option *lty = * can be used to specify the wanted line type.
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Line types specified with the lty parameter"}
knitr::include_graphics("3_2.png")
```
Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Modify line type, line width, point symbol, symbol size"}
plot(dose, drugA, type = "b", lty = 3, lwd = 3, pch = 15, cex = 2)
```
#### Color
Here are some parameters showed below.
```{r, table-knit-3, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("col", "col.axis", "col.lab", "col.main", "col.sub", "fg", "bg"),
  description = c("The default painting color, some functions can accept a vector contains color values to use circularly.",
                  "The color of the axis tick text.",
                  "The color of the axis label.",
                  "The color of the title.",
                  "The color of the subtitle.",
                  "Foreground color of the graphic.",
                  "Background color of the graphic.")
)
kable(data, caption = "Parameters for specifying color") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "3cm", latex_column_spec = "c") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "10cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
5. In R, we can specify color using color suffix, color name, hexadecimal color 
value, RGB value, HSV value, e.g., `col = 1`, `col = "white"`, `col = #FFFFFF`, 
`col = rgb(1, 1, 1)`, `col = hsv(0, 0, 1)`, these are all specify white. The *rgb()* function generates colors based on the red-green-blue values, while the *hsv()* function generates colors based on the hue-saturation-brightness values.
6. Function **colors()** will return all available color names. And there are many 
functions in R can create continuous color vectors, including **rainbow(), heat.colors(), terrain.colors(), topo.colors(), cm.colors()**. For example, *rainbow(10)* can generate 
ten continuous rainbow type colors.
7. Multi-level grayscale colors can be generated using the **gray()** function that 
comes with the basic installation. In this case, a vector with element values
between 0 and 1 is used to specify the grayscale of each color. *gray(0 : 10 / 10)* 
will generate 10-level grayscale. Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
n <- 10
mycolors <- rainbow(10)
pie(rep(1, n), labels = mycolors, col = mycolors)
mygrays <- gray(0 : n / n)
pie(rep(1, n), labels = mygrays, col = mygrays)
```

#### Text Properties
Graphic parameters can also specify font size, font, typeface.
```{r, table-knit-4, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("cex", "cex.axis", "cex.lab", "cex.main", "cex.sub"),
  description = c("Indicates the value of the zoom factor relative to the default size, the default size is one",
                  "The value of the zoom factor about axis tick text.",
                  "The value of the zoom factor about axis label.",
                  "The value of the zoom factor about title.",
                  "The value of the zoom factor about subtitle.")
)
kable(data, caption = "Parameters for specifying text size") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "3cm", latex_column_spec = "c") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "10cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
```{r, table-knit-5, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("font", "font.axis", "font.lab", "font.main", "font.sub", "ps", "family"),
  description = c("Integer. Used to specify the font style for painting. `1 = regular`, `2 = bold`, `3 = italics`, `4 = bold italics`, `5 = symbol font`(impress as Adobe symbol coding)", 
                  "The font style of axis tick text.",
                  "The font style of axis label.",
                  "The font style of title.",
                  "The font style of subtitle.",
                  "Font point size, the actual size of text is `ps*cex`.",
                  "The font family to use when drawing text.`serif` for serif, `sans` for sans serif, `mono` for fixed width.")
)
kable(data, caption = "Parameters for specifying font family, font size, font style") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "3cm", latex_column_spec = "c") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "10cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
8. We can set the font size and font style readily, but for font family, something
different. We have three font styles but map to *True Type Times New Roman*, *True Type Arial*, *True Type Courier New*, respectively. Except that three values, we can 
also use function **windowsFont()** to create this map in Windows. Here is an example.
```r
windowsFonts(
  A = windowsFont("Arial Black"),
  B = windowsFont("Bookman Old Style"),
  C = windowsFont("Comic Sans MS")
)
```
After run this clause, we can use parameter like: *par(family = "A")*. It should 
be noted that, in Mac, we should use the function **quartzFonts()** instead.

#### Graphics Size and Border Size
```{r, table-knit-6, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("pin", "mai", "mar"),
  description = c("Graphic size in inches.(width and height as numeric vector)", 
                  "The border size represented by a numeric vector in the order bottom, left, top, right, in inches(1 inch = 2.54 cm)",
                  "The border size represented by a numeric vector in the order bottom, left, top, right, in lines. By default(c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)")
)
kable(data, caption = "Parameters for specifying graphics size and border size") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "3cm", latex_column_spec = "c") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "10cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
```r
par(pin = c(4, 3), mai = c(1, .5, 1, .2))
```
The above code create graphs that are 4 inches wide by 3 inches tall, with a 1-inch 
margin on the bottom and top, a 0.5-inch margin on the left, and a 0.2-inch margin
on the right.  
For general review, here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
# Copy currrent parameter settings
opar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
# Set the size of graphs to 2 inches wide by 3 inches tall
par(pin = c(2, 3))
# Set the line width double than the default and symbol size 1.5 times to the default
par(lwd = 2, cex = 1.5)
# Set the axis tick text size 75% to the default and its font style is italics
par(cex.axis = .75, font.axis = 3)
# In graph 1, set the point type as 19 and line type as 2, color is red
plot(dose, drugA, type = "b", pch = 19, lty = 2, col = "red")
# In graph 2, set the point type as 23 and line type as 6, point background color as green, line and point border color are blue
plot(dose, drugB, type = "b", pch = 23, lty = 6, col = "blue", bg = "green")
# Restore default settings
par(opar)
```

### Add Text, Customize Axes and Legends
Many advanced functions provide the settings of axis and annotation. Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
plot(dose, drugA, type = "b", col = "red", lty = 2, pch = 2, lwd = 2, main = "Clinical Trials for drug A", sub = "This is a hypothetical data", xlab = "Dosage", ylab = "Drug Response", xlim = c(0, 60), ylim = c(0, 70))
```
The above graph adds title, subtitle, axis labels, specifies the range of axis.

#### Title
9. We can use function **title()** to add title and axis labels for graph. It's 
calling format is showed below.
```r
title(main = "main title", sub = "subtitle", xlab = "x-axis label", ylab = "y-axis label")
```
It can also specify other parameters. Here is an example.
```r
title(main = "My Title", col.main = "red", sub = "My Subtitle", col.sub = "blue", 
xlab = "My X label", ylab = "My Y label", col.lab = "green", cex.lab = 0.75)
```
10. Function *title()* is usually used to add information to a graph whose default 
title and axis labels are removed by `ann = FALSE`.

#### Axis
11. We can use function **axis()** to create customized axis. Syntax as below.
```r
axis(side, at = , labels = , pos = , lty = , col = , las = , tck = , ...)
```
The parameter above have descriptions here.
```{r, table-knit-7, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("side", "at", "labels", "pos", "lty", "col", "las", "tck", "(...)"),
  description = c("An Integer decribes where to paint axis according to graph.(`1 = bottom`, `2 = left`, `3 = top`, `4 = right`)", 
                  "A numeric vector describes where to paint scale line.",
                  "A character type vector describes the text annotation next to grids.",
                  "The coordinates of the position where the axis is drawn.(the value of the position where it intersects with another axis)",
                  "Line type.",
                  "The color of lines and grids.",
                  "If the labels be parallel to(`=0`) or be perpendicular to(`=2`) axis.",
                  "Length of tick mark as a fraction of the plotting region (a negative number is outside the graph, a positive number is inside, 0 suppresses ticks, 1 creates 
gridlines); the default is –0.01.",
                  "Other parameters.")
)
kable(data, caption = "Axis options") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "3cm", latex_column_spec = "c") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "10cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
When customize axis, we should disable the axis created by senior functions. Parameter
`axes = FALSE` will disable all axis, `xaxt = "n"`, `yaxt = "n"` will disable x axis
and y axis, respectively.

12. Function **lines()** can add new graphic elements to current graph. Function 
**mtext()** can add text to the borders of graph.

The practical example is in "3_4.R", please look up subfolder.

##### Minor Tick Marks
13. We can use function **minor.tick()** in package **Hmisc** to add minor tick 
marks. Here is the syntax.
```r
library(Hmisc)
minor.tick(nx = n, ny = n, tick.ratio = n)
```
The above parameter, `nx`, `ny` depict how many ranges divided by the minor tick 
marks between two major tick marks. `tick.ratio` is the length about minor tick 
marks, `tick.ratio = 1` depicts the same length of the major tick marks.

#### Reference Lines
14. Function **abline()** can be used to add reference lines to graph, syntax 
showed below.
```r
abline(h = yvalues, v = xvalues)
```
The function prototype showed above can also contain other graphic parameters. For
example, *abline(h = c(1, 5, 7))* will add solid horizontal lines at y = 1, 5, 7.

#### Legend
```r
legend(location, title, legend, ...)
```
```{r, table-knit-8, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("location", "title", "legend", "(...)"),
  description = c("Specify the location of legends. We always use keywords, `bottom`, `bottomleft`, `left`, `topleft`, `top`, `topright`, `right`, `bottomright`, `center`. Alternatively, we can also just specify the top left corner's coordinate. `inset` specifies how long the legend move inside the graph(as fraction of plot region)",
                  "Legend title string.",
                  "Character type vector made of legend labels.",
                  "Other parameters.")
)
kable(data, caption = "Legend options") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "3cm", latex_column_spec = "c") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "10cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
Specify `horiz = TRUE` can horizontally lay down legends instead of lay it vertically.  
The practical example is in "3_5.R", please look up subfolder.

#### Text Annotation
15. We can use function **text()** and **mtext()** to add text on graph. *text()*
can add text inside the plot region while *mtext()* can add text to one of four 
borders.
```r
text(location, "text to place", pos, ...)
mtext("text to place", side, line = n, ...)
```
```{r, table-knit-9, echo = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(magrittr)
data <- data.frame(
  parameter = c("location", "pos", "side"),
  description = c("Text location. It can be a coordinate (x, y), or specify it as `location(1)` to use mouse set its location interactively.",
                  "Position relative to location. `1 = below`, `2 = left`, `3 = above`, `4 = right`. If specify pos, we can specify `offset = ` in percent of character width.",
                  "Which margin to place text in, where `1 = bottom`, `2 = left`, `3 = top`, `4 = right`. We can specify `line = ` to indicate the line in the margin starting with 0 (closest to the plot area) and moving out. We can also specify `adj = 0` for left/bottom alignment or `adj = 1` for top/right alignment.")
)
kable(data, caption = "Options for text() and mtext()") %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "bordered"), 
                full_width = FALSE) %>% 
    column_spec(1, width = "3cm", latex_column_spec = "c") %>% 
    column_spec(2, width = "10cm", latex_column_spec = "c")
```
Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
attach(mtcars)
  plot(wt, mpg, main = "Mileage vs. Car Weight", xlab = "Weight", ylab = "Mileage",
       pch = 18, col = "blue")
  # Add text annotations on (wt, mpg)
  text(wt, mpg, row.names(mtcars), cex = 0.6, pos = 4, col = "red")
detach(mtcars)
```

#### Math Annotations
16. Finally, we can add mathematical symbols and formulas to a graph using TEX-like rules.
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "35%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Partial results of demo(plotmath)"}
knitr::include_graphics("3_3.png")
```

### Combining Graphs
17. We can use function **par()** pr **layout()** in R to easily combine multiple
graphs to general one.
```r
# Filled by row
par(mfrow = c(nrows, ncols))
# Filled by column
par(mfcol = c(nrows, ncols))
```
Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
attach(mtcars)
  opar <- par(no.readonly = TRUE)
  par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
  plot(wt, mpg, main = "Scatterplot of wt vs. mpg")
  plot(wt, disp, main = "Scatterplot of wt vs. disp")
  hist(wt, main = "Histogram of wt")
  boxplot(wt, main = "Boxplot of wt")
  par(opar)
detach(mtcars)
```
The function **layout()** has syntax as below.
```r
layout(allocation_matrix, widths = c(col1, col2, ...), heights = c(row1, row2, ...))
```
The above parameter, *allocation_matrix* is the graph allocation matrix, *byrow*
is whether to filled by row. *widths* and *heights* are vectors, describe the width
or height about each column or row. Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
attach(mtcars)
  layout(matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 3), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE),
         widths = c(3, 1), heights = c(1, 2))
  hist(wt)
  hist(mpg)
  hist(disp)
detach(mtcars)
```
The above code, *matrix(c(1, 1, 2, 3), nrow = 2, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)* means 
the first graph will occupy the whole first row, and the second row contains the 
second graph and the third graph.

#### Fine-Grained Control over Graph Layout
18. We can also assign more meaningful location to each graph using parameter `fig = `.
Parameter *fig = * is a numeric vector resembles `c(x1, x2, y1, y2)`.
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "40%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap = "Schematic diagram using parameter 'fig'"}
knitr::include_graphics("3_4.png")
```

Before we add each graph, we should use *fig* as parameter in function *par()* to
specify the appointed area for the following graph. And there are another parameter
should be focused on, `new`, this parameter specifies the following graph will be
added to the current window but not replace it. The reason to mention this is *fig*
will create a new graph by default, so we should also specify `new = TRUE` in
function *par()* when using parameter *fig*. Here is an example.
```{r, include = TRUE, fig.align = "center"}
